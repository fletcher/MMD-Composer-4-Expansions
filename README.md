## MultiMarkdown Composer 4 Expansion Files ##

This repository includes some sample JSON files to configure custom text
expansion in MMD Composer 4.

The files should be installed in:

	~/Library/Containers/com.multimarkdown.composer4.mac/Data/Library/Application Support/MultiMarkdown Composer 4/Expansions

(Or you can use the Pro Preferences in Composer to go directly to that folder)

These files include some sample expansions to show you what is possible.  Feel
free to customize them as you wish.  If you have ideas for improvements, feel
free to submit a pull request, or you can share your own files on the support
site:
